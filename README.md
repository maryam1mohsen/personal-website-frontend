# Personal Website using MERN stack

![App Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Description

This **Personal Website** is a full-stack application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It serves as a comprehensive platform where I can showcase my portfolio, share blogs, and allow visitors to engage with the content through comments and contact forms. The project reflects my skills in web development, both on the client-side and server-side, with a strong emphasis on user experience and responsive design.

The website allows users to browse my portfolio and view detailed project descriptions. It also features a fully functional blog section where I share posts on various topics. Registered users can sign in to leave comments and interact with my blog posts. This platform demonstrates my ability to create dynamic web applications with authentication and CRUD functionality.

The inspiration behind building this website was to create a space where I could centralize my creative work and provide a seamless, engaging user experience for visitors. Whether someone is interested in viewing my portfolio, reading my blogs, or reaching out through the contact form, this website brings everything together in one place.
